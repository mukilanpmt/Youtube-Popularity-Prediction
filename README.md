# YouTube Popularity Prediction

Predicting the popularity of YouTube videos using machine learning techniques based on video metadata and engagement metrics.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze YouTube video data and build a machine learning model to predict whether a video will become popular or not. Popularity is defined based on thresholds such as view count, likes, or trending status.

The dataset contains information about YouTube trending videos, including attributes such as:

- Video title  
- Channel name  
- Category  
- Publish date  
- View count  
- Likes and dislikes  
- Comment count  

Using these features, the project applies classification algorithms to predict video popularity.
